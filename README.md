 This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets gathered from Twitter. By utilizing the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), this project performs sentiment analysis on tweets to categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral based on the content of the text.

Key features:

- Data Collection: Using the Twitter API (Tweepy) to gather tweets based on keywords or hashtags.
- Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the tweet data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and applying stemming/lemmatization.
- Sentiment Classification: Leveraging sentiment analysis techniques with NLTK's built-in sentiment analyzer (VADER) to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- Visualization: Generating visual representations (such as pie charts or bar graphs) to display the distribution of sentiments among the collected tweets.
- Technologies Used:

-- Python
-- NLTK (VADER for sentiment analysis)
-- Tweepy (for Twitter API)
-- Pandas (for data handling)
-- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
